Things to do

 - [X] Define shim for cdtime
 - [ ] Define shim for udunits
 - [ ] Define shim for bindex (maybe leave NotImplemented)
 - [X] Do we need regrid2?
   - Assume no -- can be extended later if necessary
   - We are removing regrid2, genutil and cdutil for the moment
 - [X] Remove references to cdat_info
 - [ ] Turn shim API into ABC
 - [ ] Port all license terms over


Importing cdms2 requires cdtime to work therefore we should start with that.

Do we need regrid?  It is used by cdms2.axis, cdms2.avariable and cdms2.grid

 - cdms2.axis : only used to create gausian/equalarea axes.  Reimplement
 - cdms2.avariable 
   - used in several regrid methods. Remove
   - used in subSlice in some circumstances : possibly used for rotated grids.  Remove with warning.
 - cdms2.grid : 
   - used in genBounds() (similar to cdms2.axis) : reimplement
   - used in classify() : as above
