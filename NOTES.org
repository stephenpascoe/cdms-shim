Things to do

 - [ ] Define shim for cdtime
 - [ ] Define shim for udunits
 - [ ] Define shim for bindex (maybe leave NotImplemented)
 - [X] Do we need regrid2?
   - Assume no -- can be extended later if necessary
   - We are removing regrid2, genutil and cdutil for the moment
 - [X] Remove references to cdat_info
 - [ ] Turn shim API into ABC
 - [ ] Port all license terms over
